New cafes / art spaces are opening up every other week. Also, many temples that disseminate Buddhist teachings and run mindfulness retreats near and around the city.

Oct to Jan is a cool season with Dec to early Feb being the blooming season. While each season brings a different flavor with it, Chiang Mai is a paradise throughout excepting the burning season period.  Other notes: English proficiency of the local population is basic.

1705708829,Europe,1716855,"Warsaw, as a destination for digital nomads, presents a mixed bag of experiences. It's often praised for its affordability, good quality of life, and excellent infrastructure, including fast internet and walkable neighborhoods【8†source】【7†source】. However, it's also characterized by a bustling atmosphere, high traffic, and an ongoing political agenda that some find off-putting.  While many digital nomads and locals have found a home in Warsaw, it's worth noting that this city may not be everyone's first choice. Many reside here out of necessity, due to work or university commitments. This is not to say that Warsaw lacks charm or potential; it's just that it takes time to grow on you. The city's culture, like its architecture, is often described as ""brutalist"", and it can take up to three years of living there to fully integrate and form a strong social network.  Nevertheless, there are aspects of Warsaw that are beloved by its residents. Enthusiasts of brutalist architecture will find much to admire in the cityscape, and the Vistula river offers delightful kayaking opportunities. The city is also home to a vibrant restaurant scene, although these establishments can be crowded and often require waiting for a table. Prices can be steep, and while the quality of the food is generally high, some establishments may not live up to their hype.  In comparison, cities like Kraków, Gdańsk, and Gdynia, along with smaller towns in Southern Poland, are often considered more appealing to digital nomads. These locations offer a slower pace of life, less crowding, and a more relaxed atmosphere, making them preferable for those who value tranquility and close-knit communities over the hustle and bustle of the capital.  In conclusion, while Warsaw has its merits, it is not a city that appeals to everyone. Its crowdedness, high traffic, and political climate can be off-putting to some. However, for those who are willing to look past these aspects and give it time, Warsaw can offer a unique and rewarding experience. As always, your mileage may vary, and it's recommended to visit before making a commitment.",warsaw-poland,warsaw,warsaw-poland,10,2000,809,161800,,47.66019417475729,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/warsaw-poland.jpg?1705708829",华沙,Warsaw,波兰,76,,52.2296756,21.0122287,Poland,PL,poland,,,,128,5,3.334285714285714,84,22,wi-day-rain,🌧,12,54.008,12,54,2730,1812,1301,4554.555387077457,3.8682949186653017,3.8682949186653017,3.5942857142857143,5,4.5,4.5
1705622563,Europe,562379,"Lived in Copenhagen for just under three years, and for the whole time, I have worked remotely as a freelancer. It's pretty much as perfect as you're going to get in terms of urban design; getting around is easy and safe by bike, and the public transport network is efficient and reasonably-priced. Lots of fun things to do for a relatively small city, and the locals are—from personal experience—incredibly friendly.   Pros:  - Very safe. You can walk around most areas round-the-clock and not have to worry, violent crime is largely gang-related but even then still quite rare   - Lots of fun things to do, many of which don't require a huge budget. For example, you can swim in the harbor baths year-round and simply sit outside with a book when the weather is good. Nightlife is pretty decent for pubs, bars, and restaurants; I'm not a huge fan of clubs in general, so I can't comment too much on that.   - The council actively tries to improve locals' quality of life, which is a huge contrast to where I am from (London)   - Friendly locals and a big international community. It can be hard to make friends, but I would say that you'll be okay if you join clubs/actively pursue your own interests. Instagram and MeetUp are both great options for finding people with similar hobbies :)   - A good mix of architecture. You've got pretty old houses and more interesting modern designs, some are hideous (i.e. Kaktus Towers) but most blend in quite well IMO   - The airport is very good, close to the city center, and has lots of flights across Europe and other continents   - Close to both mainland Europe and the rest of Scandinavia. You can get to Hamburg in 4.5 hours by train, for example, and Sweden is not far away   - Summer in Copenhagen is amazing. Long daylight hours, reliable weather for the most part, feels like you're on a two-and-a-half month long holiday.   - Lots of coworking spaces. I usually work from Spaces, Regus has various offices as well but these are hit and miss. The best ones are Havnegade and Fuglevangsvej in my opinion  Cons:   - Winters aren't great. It's windy, it rains a lot, and the daylight hours are short. However, that's a great excuse to visit the many cafés and restaurants, because hygge and stuff :)   - The cost of living is much higher than most European cities. If you're moving here as a remote worker and staying long-term, I would personally say that you should ensure that your income is at least $5,500 per month. Taxes are also high  - The housing market is a bit of a mess. Rent prices are high and it can be difficult to find an apartment if you're on a budget. Movinn and LifeX are two choices you can look at as starting points   - Moving to Denmark if you're not an EU/EEA/Nordic/Swiss citizen is very difficult. I have an EU citizenship through one of my parents so this didn't affect me, but you'll have to deal with a lot of paperwork if you aren't one. If you're from EU/EEA/Nordics/Switzerland, it's pretty easy if you have the means to support yourself   - The city center can be quite crowded on weekends, especially around Nyhavn etc.—but if you leave the touristy parts, you'll be fine. Copenhagen has plenty of other interesting neighborhoods anyway :)   Overall, I would say that Copenhagen is easily one of the most liveable cities in Europe—if not top of the list. The cost of living is high and it can be difficult to move here, but once you've settled, life is pretty good in my opinion. You can get around with English, but learning Danish opens new opportunities and a lot of stuff is done in Danish rather than English. If you're able to move here, and you can stand the winter weather, I highly recommend it :) ",copenhagen-denmark,copenhagen,copenhagen-denmark,8,1600,880,176000,,68.1329549363605,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/copenhagen-denmark.jpg?1705622563",哥本哈根,Copenhagen,丹麦,27,,55.6760968,12.5683371,Denmark,DK,denmark,,,,95,5,4.954285714285714,77,23,wi-day-cloudy,🌥,7,44.812,5,41,4801,3570,2361,8263.289933197118,3.844956545747795,3.844956545747795,1.2274285714285713,5,5,4.5

Compared to all the places I've been, Las Palmas has the best community if you're trying to connect with people (both digital nomads and expats). The community is so great because of some key people such as the girl who founded the Slack channel called 'Live it up, Las Palmas'. There's a Spanish teacher called 'La Casita de Laura' which also organizes monthly events and free language exchange plus there are some new projects such as a sharing platform called 'sharebee'.

Join the Cycling-Group Running, fine dining, women in business, crypto, ... you get it, the list goes on.   As mentioned in another comment: There's been some hatred going on against digital nomads.

Been coming to medellin for like 7 years mainly for vacations, while weather is good (spring like) i prefer a bit colder myself. Everything is cheap, and colombians in general are friendly and welcoming. Have watched as the city has been invaded by more and more gringos over the years, it now has become sort of like a colombian cancun vacation spot, but less trashy.  Did not find it dangerous at all, though it could be at night if you look like a clueless gringo. I am told i give off narco vibes lmao, so maybe thats why I never have trouble. Careful with the drugs here they are very strong, personally I would avoid. Also screen the women you date, I hear scoplamine can be a problem never faced it myself. There is a saying ""don' give papaya"" in colombia it basically means don't look like an easy target and you will be alright.   Some reviews say this place is mainly for male expats, sure with the gorgeous girls everywhere, but if western women want to be left alone this is the place to go, you will be ignored!  A lot of foreign investment coming into the city in the form of new hotels etc, wish I had bought a property here back in 2017, airbnbs get rented out very easily and certain times of year it is impossible to find a room (christmas).

Of course you can spend it if you want, but actually we're a family of four and our monthly balance is about 3000$. we don't own a car, we don't go out every evening, we don't live in punta carretas. of course, if you want to live in the most expensive neighborhood and want to dinner out sushi every day you need a lot of money, but normally 4000 usd/month for one person are a very good amount 2) internet speed: Montevideo and most of uruguay have optic fiber, for 50 usd/month you can get a 100/30 mpbs connection, the problem maybe the international bandwidth (I can use ssh to remote server in europe with a slightly delay), we watch netflix etc with no problem. also you can buy an LTE mobile chip with a very good speed (I can do RDP with no problems at all) but more delay in international routing. 3) tap water: it's generally drinkable, maybe you can buy a filter, but lot of people drink it 4) yes, the city can be pretty boring compared to other options (like buenos aires, for example) and there's no much variety 5) safety: yes, it's safer than other latin america cities, but if you go around with dollars sticking out of your pocket, an iphone in one hand, an ipad in the other, the latest model of nikon around your neck, an open backpack with a laptop sticking out of it and looking around bewildered, maybe even in a complicated barrio... well, you increase the chances of being robbed... since it's not tokyo (and there are complicated areas there too) you need to have some ability to understand the context  Hope this help!",montevideo-uruguay,montevideo,montevideo-uruguay,5,1000,313,62600,,269.3103448275862,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/montevideo-uruguay.jpg?1705622468",蒙得维的亚,Montevideo,乌拉圭,0,,-34.883611,-56.181944,Uruguay,UY,uruguay,,,,50,5,5,59,54,wi-day-sunny,☀️,23,72.856,23,73,2830,1699,890,3113.9538303219647,3.523122696552408,3.523122696552408,3.48,3.5714285714285716,5,2.75

1705449625,Europe,545200,"Once you figure out housing (not an easy thing but doable, especially once you stop looking in the touristic areas), Lisbon is a very charming, safe (even though I'll admit this is getting worse in certain areas), and fun city to live in. In most neighbourhoods you have the feeling of living in a small town instead of an urban area. There's aways something to do or see so it's hard to be bored living here. I still find Lisbon (and Portugal in general), to be one of the most attractive places in Europe (especially if you care about the weather).  Excluding rent, cost of living is pretty much the same you'd pay for similar european cities, but with more bang for your buck imo. The stuff you find at the grocery store (I recommend shopping at the bigger Continentes, like the Telheiras one) or at your local butcher (your local butcher will always have the highest quality meat all around) is much much better than what you'd find at your average grocery store in the UK or Germany (in my experience).  The people can be incredibly nice, but interactions are often a hit or miss, and lots of times locals will be rude for no reason. Service-wise, I recommend learning to distinguish between the various flavors of Portuguese accents to increase chances of finding better customer-oriented places (eg.: Brazilian-owned or staffed places tend to have above average service, not always but it's noticeable).  The city is clearly going through the pains of growing (and becoming more of an alpha city), and conciliating that with everything else ain't easy. But if you enjoy this kind of environment, again, there's lots to do.  The things the gov needs to address here are some but very large, imo: - Ease of building (no wonder you have a housing shortage when it's so damn hard to build anything) - Simpler and more straightforward company/tax structures so us foreigners can move our companies here and fully assimilate - Aggressively expand and modernize public transport especially in the outskirts of the city center.  - A new airport away from the city center (the current airport is a joke for the current demand. Again, pains of growth).  In short, if I can give a single tip to anyone moving here medium to long term, is be prepared to spend A LOT of your time looking for a place to live that suits you. Learn some Portuguese, take the bus to some random areas, walk around the neighborhoods you find charming, and don't be afraid to ask if they know anything for rent. Landlords on short-term websites like Uniplaces, Airbnb, etc might also be willing to rent long term, so ask them.  Also, learn some Portuguese!

Bogota is a tech capital in latam, so a decent place to farm out work, although dont expect mass english proficiency.

Chapinero and 85 are good for parties. Careful in chapinero at night, dont drink too much. Safety can be a problem mainly at night but if you live in chico,rosales, usaquen you dont really need to worry so much. Also Bogota is one of the most creative cities not just latam but worldwide. A true haven for artists of all types, big graffiti culture, and a ton of cool museums. Place is generally cheap if you earn dollars, but if you wanna spend big there are places. Also good for people on a budget as well. Weather wise it rains a lot and almost has a permanent ""fall feeling"". If you love fall its the place for you.

1707782469,North America,8398748,"New York is cool. I’ve visited multiple times to see my family throughout my life, and recently came back from my first post-COVID trip there. Yes, it’s very expensive — but there is no city on earth that’s more captivating in my opinion. I used to think that New Yorkers were smug by claiming that NYC was better than everywhere else, but now I totally get it lol.   My personal favourite neighbourhood is the Upper East Side, which is where you’ll find the coveted Museum Mile. But I also like Harlem and Brooklyn. Truthfully, the best thing you can do is just wander around with stops in local eateries along the way.   As another reviewer mentioned, there’s a lot of main character energy in NYC. Personally, I love that — and I always feel energised when I’m here. It makes me want to go out and achieve my biggest dreams, and the New York skyline is captivating.   In terms of safety, I actually found NYC safer when visiting than I have prior to COVID. I may have just been lucky, and I was only there for a week, but that’s my opinion/experience. YMMV, of course. Some subway stations made me feel on edge, but my experience was fine for the most part. (I still think the subway needs a huge revamp, though, as it’s definitely looking quite tired 😄).   I would love to come back here and live for 3-12 months. Anything more than that would probably be too much for me personally, but at least visiting is something that you must do at least once. And even if you come here 20+ times, there’ll always be something interesting that you haven’t seen/experienced before.

1705536077,Europe,821752,"I recently visited Amsterdam for the third time (and the first time since 2018). I personally think it's a little overrated, but a cool place to visit nonetheless.   The architecture is beautiful, and there are lots of good places to eat. I don't like the main area of the canals in the city centre; it smells of weed and is often packed. However, the outer edges - such as the Jordaan district - are less busy and more interesting in my opinion.   One thing that surprised me is how much trash was on the streets. Many bins were full, and there was waste - such as abandoned mattresses - in a lot of areas. Some people have said this is because of the bottle deposit initiative and people looking through the trash, but I live in Copenhagen and we have this... yet the city is much cleaner IMO.   If you visit, try to come on a weekday. Also, the streets near the canals can be quite chaotic with bikes, cars, and scooters. Again, I'm used to bikes as I live in Copenhagen and cycle myself - but it's much more organised than in Amsterdam IMO.   Pros:  - Beautiful architecture  - The people are nice  - Efficient public transport  - Good food and nightlife   Cons:  - Very dirty  - Crowded in the central parts  - Can feel quite chaotic   I would recommend visiting Amsterdam, but I don't know if I would personally live there. The Netherlands has plenty of places that are just as beautiful and interesting, such as Utrecht, Leiden, and Haarlem.

Issues such as rats in the walls, leaking roofs, homeless sleeping on the entrances, and cockroach infestations are common, yet you'll still be charged no less than 1500 without utilities, possibly more.

1705622579,Europe,418495,"I spent a month in Tirana in February 2022 and then returned in October for a one-week stay. Generally, I was pleasantly surprised and would recommend Tirana. Here are my Pros and Cons:  Pros: - Cheap: Airbnbs are cheap (especially on a monthly basis), food is very cheap (around a third of what you would pay in Germany) and still good quality (most of the time). - Walkable: The city center is pretty compact and everything can be reached on foot - Green: The city center has multiple parks around the main boulevard. The big city park has an artificial lake and paths for runners and cyclists. - Nice People: All locals that I talked to were very nice. I once went to the barber who was the nicest dude ever. We talked for around 1.5 hours about Albania, politics, economics and so on. That way, I learned a lot about the country. - Great coworking cafes: I can recommend the Destil Creative Hub and the Coolab. Nice people, good coffee and a good internet connection. Stay away from the #TECHSPACE, though. Very bad internet, tedious to even get in, not a good experience there. - Safe: I never felt unsafe, even when walking back to my Airbnb at night. There also were a lot of women walking around at night. Also, locals told me that pickpocketing is not a problem in Tirana since there are only few tourists. - Night Life: There are many bars around the city center. Even during the week, there are many people out partying.  Cons: - Boring: There is not much to do generally. There are a few museums like the National History Museum, the two Bunk'art museums (old bunkers from communist times) and the House of Leaves. All of them are focused on Albanian History. I can especially recommend Bunk'art 1. It's impressive to wander through this huge bunker. The National History Museum starts strong with a really cool exhibition of relicts and statues from Ancient times on the ground floor. On the top floors, most texts are not translated into English. Also, the exhibitions are partially very old school or trashy (the exhibition about Mother Teresa looks like it was designed by a child in Word 2003). - No digital nomad community: I would have loved to meet more digital nomads, but sadly there is no real community there (yet). - Cars: Traffic is insane in the city. And people drive like crazy. Take care when walking over the road (even at crosswalks). I was almost hit by a car on the crosswalk twice. Also, I was surprised that I made it from the airport to the city and back without an accident, considering the driving style of most drivers. - Coldness: Since it's pretty hot in Albania for most of the year, most buildings don't have heating or well-isolated walls (apartments as well as restaurants, museums etc.). I was there in February and I was constantly cold. So I would recommend visiting Tirana in spring or autumn when it's neither cold nor super hot. In October, the temperature was nice. - Public Toilets: Toilets in public places and restaurants are mostly filthy and unhygienic. Most places don't have urinals, still most men appear to urinate standing up and have terrible aim. That leads to piss being all over the toilet and on the floor. It was like this almost everywhere I went.  Generally, I enjoyed my time in Tirana and I definitely plan to visit a third time. I can recommend it to everyone, but especially to people who are on a budget.  In spring, you can get a nice Airbnb in the city center for around 500€ - 700€ a month, WizzAir offers cheap flights to Tirana from many major European cities (100€ - 150€ there and back) and food is pretty cheap (main course + drink around 10€ at most restaurants).

Native cuisine is delicious, maybe the best value restaurants in Europe.  8 months of pleasant weather. Old town is pretty charming. Local fruits are excellent and inexpensive. 1 Euro taxi rides.

The boardwalk on the coast is long and excellent - perfect for running and cycling. Kutaisi airport is only a 24 euro taxi ride away, so lots of cheap connections to central Europe and FSU.  Cons: Roads are total chaos, being a pedestrian is scary. International food options and supermarkets are limited.  New apartment towers are poorly built, extremely noisy and waiting for the elevator can waste 30 minutes of your day.  Businesses seem poorly managed, this results in queues and mistakes.

I standby everything I wrote in the previous review with a few additions:  - This town is incredibly small and word travels fast. You will see the same people when grocery shopping, when you stop at an Oxxo for petrol, and when you go to the late night bars. Lots of unnecessary immature drama/in-fighting. I try to stay away from these people. I would recommend you do the same.  - The police have stepped up the corruption. They are essentially legal criminals. Please wear a helmet and have a proper motorcycle/scooter license. Don’t carry a lot of cash on you. I’ve heard many stories of police stopping people and just taking their money.  - My friend and I were chatting and agreed that Puerto brings a lot of broken people. I’m no exception. Most of the long term people seem to be running away from something. Puerto by its nature is very remote, very hard to access.   - The town got packed fast when busy season started in October.

There's amazing food (Asian, Western and fusion). You'll be surrounded by entrepreneurs, artists, fashion designers and models. Many of whom do speak English.  It gets better if you speak basic Mandarin though. You don't need to care about the characters. Just learn to speak, that's important enough. The nice thing about Mandarin is China is so big everyone has an accent, so for Chinese it really doesn't matter so much that you have one too.  Depending on how and what kind of money you make, your experience also changes. Like most places in Asia, English teachers are the lowest rank in the hierarchy of foreigners here. Chinese know. But if you're an entrepreneur, even (or especially) an online one, that's high regarded. The problem with working online here is obviously the firewall which can make it very difficult. I've heard good stories about Shadowsocks which seems to work better than regular VPNs.  The recent China vs. America tensions are in fact making people slightly more hostile against Western foreigners. But remember this is Shanghai, it's a metropolitan city, they're usually much less xenophobic than out in the country.

At first I stayed at the Parijatha Gateway Hotel, Near Soap Factory Metro, which was ideal for my purposes.  Transit & shopping was nearby, and there was a mall and good food.  The Metro in BLR is VERY modern and smooth- be prepared to be patted down (women and men separately) to get into the station, and you can but a metrocard at the ticket window.  In Bangalore the internet is VERY fast (it is India's Silicon Valley) and every other person is an engineer... and can chat you up in multiple languages.( their English may be better than yours :).  Uber works well inside the city, but I advise a pre-paid taxi from the airport to your hotel (as flagging down your Uber at the airport is a bit difficult because of the congestion there).  Now, lets talk about  traffic- I have lived in NYC and I can say with authority that, yes, Bangalore has the worst traffic congestion I have ever seen. Any time that Google maps gives you to get anywhere by Auto or bus in Bangalore can be Doubled or Tripled to get the actual time of transit- you can't make this sit up... I am not kidding. All that aside, I never felt unsafe in Bangalore.   Food in Bangalore is varied and tasty...  You will have a good variety of Vegetarian and non-vegetarian options available to you.  I did not seek out the night life, but there sure are some fancy upscale places if you want them.   My second stay ion the trip was at the Conrad Hilton, which is in a class all by itself but not your everyday Nomad kind of place (My expenses were being covered for that, the price per night is insanely low by western standards, and so if you need some amazing pampering for a night or two, this is your go-to place) .

However, these days, after having seen most of Europe and some of the US, I can't help but feel that Gdansk's old town is small and everything that surrounds it has a distinct, post-communist feel, which I do not enjoy. I was there this summer (2022) and it felt like being in an amusement park, with many of the apartment complexes around the old town turning into cheap, short stay aparthotels. The place felt empty due to that. The biggest allure of the city is that it is so close to the sea. Unfortunately, as locals would tell you, it is extremely crowded when the weather is nice, therefore most locals avoid the sea in the summer, which to me sounds weird. Considering the climate, I wouldn't want to be near that sea outside of the summer time!

No co-working spaces available in Pokhara at this time. Overall I'd definitely recommend it but the inverter is a must!

Seminyak is not 'Balifornia' (Canguu), some will like it for that reason alone.   Traffic can get clogged in Seminyak but it's still far better than Canggu. Seminyak is just as commercialized as Canggu, but in a different way. If you're familiar with NY, Canggu has east village or lower east side vibes, while Seminyak is more soho.   Of course neither comes close to the actual NY neighborhoods. You could say Seminyak  is more polished with better infrastructure, so you'll find more sidewalks and high end artisan shops, while Canggu is like a super westernized village. Both areas are full of tourists, expats, and nomads, so you'll find plenty of good co working spaces, vegan cafes, and good coffee in Seminyak.  If you're trying to avoid mosquitos (and the gekkos they bring), there are definitely less in some parts of Seminyak, due to the infrastructure being more built up, although you still need to use repellent. Be alert to Seminyak scammers, they will spot you from a mile if you're western.  Thankfully my NY skills made it easy to avoid and/or get rid of them. Seminyak has some of the best beachfront bars and cafes, with pools overlooking the sea, better than what you find in Canggu. Don't get me wrong, I still love Canggu, just not thrilled with what it's become, and Seminyak provides an escape that's just a grab or scooter ride away.  If you decide to check out Seminyak you need to dig to find the gems. Because on the surface it's pretty typical, but once you discover some of the amazing places there, you can create your own hideaway. It took me a few days and many hours of research, by foot and online, to find the best hidden places of Seminyak.

For beaches, it's best to visit Samal Island or spend a few days in Mati (approximately a three-hour drive). You won't encounter many Westerners or nomads here. Tourism is starting to pick up again after the pandemic, but most visitors are from Asia.

Organic shops just starting ,spiritual community just starting..  Few scattered ppl across the west of Crete. It has apparently started to change now, more and more expats coming, I see more and larger FB nomad groups.. back then there was absolutely nothing of such kind. I had tried to create community through couchsurfing back then and met a few interesting people. However I can confirm what was written before. There sems to be a nomad group and coworking now in Chania. Check in Facebook, I saw it.   Since 2019 the prices have risen and rent has not been affordable anymore. that's why I left in 2019. I was unable of find an apartment to rent all year. They tolerate you from Septebemr to May, then you have to leave.. where to? Even if you were ok to pay 700EUR plus amonth for an apartment, I couldn't find anyone interested in renting out year round. Mind you I do speak greek.  The greeks just make airbnb for 3 months in summer, then go to the olive picking...dancing in winter  then spring comes back. ITs a simple life for them and they don't think much ahead.  And they obviously dont need the extra income from housing. They all still own houses and land, so they dont need to worry about basic needs. Easiest is probably if you just buy a house  in a village. But that comes with structural problems.   Police, hospitals, public services,  workers, are not reliable.  Also if you have greek friends, they are nice as long as you give money, but you will never be part of the family and you can never rely fully on them. Just be warned. Good to have a mix  of friends. You ned the greeks to get the greek price and to get treated right otherwise you will be screwed over all the time.   If you are ok to bitt eh bullet, it can be enjoyable. Weather and the sea is great, and food is amazing. If you are very very patient then it might be your thing.  It really depends what you are looking for.  Internet was terrrible back then.

1706227310,Europe,552267,"Liverpool is not a great place to live as a nomad. It is a perfect tourist / nightlife city; evident at the weekend where hordes of locals and partygoers from the surrounding areas descend on the city centre (bachelor and bachelorettes included). It has probably the best nightlife in the UK, due to the fact the city centre has perfect walkability and the local government has ensured there are ideal pockets of bars and clubs placed optimally around town.  A Londoner born and raised, I lived there for 5 years, leaving in June 2023 having become a nomad in February that year. Once becoming a nomad, all of the glaring issues arose which are important for a good nomad lifestyle which make it unsuitable to live in once adopting this lifestyle.  1. Nomadlist is accurate that it is very difficult to make friends here. There is a dominant university core of students who have a hostile attitude toward 'outsiders' (i.e. locals). This wouldnt be an issue in and of itself, but due to the city not having a sufficient young professional workforce (techy or otherwise) there arent many people in the city who you will have much in common with. Coupled with the fact that Scousers (Native Liverpool residents) are superficially friendly (they may be great to you on a night out, but they will never truly be your friend) it means the city has very jarring socio-demographics.  2. It is getting more expensive; with more and more Londoners realising the north is more cost effective, rent costs and general costs of everything has increased dramatically due to this. This is happening across the country in 2023-24, but due to the city actually declining somewhat, (ill get to that) there is no real justification for these cost increases (especially housing)  3. The weather is pretty terrible most of the year. In summer you may get a week of decent weather (and there is nowhere better to be than by the River Mersey on a hot day), but it can be very depressing, especially during winter.  4. The city government is not investing in city matters that will improve the city; they seem to only want to invest in matters relating to nightlife, and appeasing the local population who aren't particularly forward thinking. For example, there doesnt seem to be any new business's moving to the city, therefore any young professionals graduating from one of the five universities here, dont have any incentive to stay, live and invest in the city.

It's also not as 'sleepy' as everyone describes and not as cheap. Everyone knows each other and it's easy to dig into berber culture. Start with the taxi rank manager and ask about pretty much anything. Moroccan's love to help. You'll be sold weed every 10 meters, make of that what you will. Best things to do here are eat, surf and relax. Seems like a lot of construction and investment is going into this place so catch it while it's 'quiet'. I'd avoid staying on the main street as it's loud pretty much all the time with dogs barking, cats fighting, etc. I found Booking (website) to be the cheapest accommodation but nothing beats landing and getting stuck in to find a place for even cheaper.

My personal recommendations : visit the tea factory of Bois Cheri, taste the Vanilla Rum of Saint-Aubin, hop in the beautiful lagoon of Pointe d'Esny, and hike Le Morne at sunrise. I cherish every single one of these visits.    I would also recommend to be accompanied by an agency to get your visa, find a trusted real estate agency, choose your local insurance, etc. I asked Smart Traveller, they are specialised in helping digital nomads come settle in Mauritius and they were the best. Young and friendly team, professional and human. Cannot recommend them enough actually.   Still a great adventure to be here in Mauritius working remotely and a dream come true for my family and I.

The atmosphere is very laid-back, the locals are friendly and open to foreigners, and there is a lot of freedom (no stupid regulations or other rules). The infrastructure is definitely not as developed as in other countries, but it is developing very quickly. There are a lot of foreign investments because the country is probably the safest in South America, and the local government is small and right-wing. In the city itself, there is not much to do. There are some nice bars, padel courts, shopping centers, etc. The best thing you can do in the evening after work is to jump into the pool, drink a beer, and do asado (barbecue). It is a great place to chill. Living costs are lower compared to Europe or other countries in Latam.  Personally, I came here to set up a residency, and my plan was to stay a maximum of 2 weeks. I have been here for 4 months already, and I am sure there are many more to come. And I am not alone. There are many people in the same situation, some of them already moved to Paraguay.

It's well-known for its truck factory, but it also boasts a charming historical city center. Though it might not be as grand as Kraków's, Lublin's city center is still worth exploring.

1705449650,North America,193744,"Did the previous reviewer say world class art and culture?  Where would this be because after 2 years there, I was craving art and culture.  Like, my experience is the polar opposite so unless art includes street statues that happen a month of each year and if by culture meaning you run into a single black guy on the street, I don't get it.  It's really white, very few Hispanics, almost no blacks and few Asians.  No museums (outside of historical ones).  Most of the Mormons live in Provo if that matters. There weren't really any sketchy areas I've encountered in SLC.  SLC is a good city to visit especially if you're skiing.  If you're not skiing, I don't know what else you can do.  I found the city to be quite boring.    The national parks in eastern and southern UT are gorgeous but we're talking 4-8 hour drive away. Skiing is great. I personally like Park City but it's boring there too. Dating sucks all around. Between recovering Mormons to Mormons, there aren't a lot in between even if the city attracts non-mormons to work there.  And if you're not white, it'll be a struggle in the dating scene.  SLC nightlife is dominated mainly by college kids.  There's only 3 places that I'd consider hanging at as a 30's and up nomad and they're not very close to each other.  It's a walkable city although things are a bit spread apart.    The new SLC airport did not consider those who fly on airlines other than Delta.

Probably 10-15 restaurants were open in the old town, including the main grocery store.

It's more about being associated with other muslim ethnicities like Arabs, Afghans etc. and also because many of these groups cause economic issues in the country - it's complicated. About the positive stuff: Izmir is for sure a better option than Istanbul, which is waay to packed and crowded. Of course Izmir is crowded too, but not nearly as Istanbul. Yes, people are very friendly, that's just part of turkish culture. It's not 100% safe, since the whole country is still dealing with poverty and has gone trough many crisisis.

1705968247,Middle East,4007526,"This was my first experience living in the Middle East. I lived here 2 years. It's such a diferent culture: the dressing, the food, the music, their traditions.   It's more modern than some other Arab countries but it is still a male dominant society. Female don't have a very active role in the public Jordanian society. Of course I met many couples where the woman is the dominant one and makes all the desicions, but it is the man that takes action in public.   As the minimum national salaries are around 300JD -395 Euros, I was expecting Amman to be cheaper, but surprisingly prices are similar to many Europeans capitals. Just housing can be cheaper depending on neighbourhood. Amman is a dirty, crowded, trafficking and a poor city with some rich well kept neighbours, like Abdoun. There is no much Middle class. It's a big contrast between luxury and poverty. And the government don't seem to care how can people survive with a salary of 300JD while the cheapest house is 300/ 350JD. The wives normally don't work. It's a family support  system.  Foreigns pay more in places like the Downtown. That used to be a more traditional area and now is more ""modernized""due to tourism.  To avoid male attention, I would recommend woman  to just wear big cleavages and mini skirts in clubs and bars, in rich neighbours. Female foreigns  are considered easy and promiscuous for having boyfriends and not marrying virgin.  Arabs are friendly but that doesn't mean that they like you. They are very envious, love to brag and to show off and the majority is inexperienced. They leave parents home to marry. The ones that studied in university maybe are a bit different.  Traffic is crazy and people don't follow any rules. They just respect traffic police and red traffic lights. There are not many public transports . There are buses that are cheap but crowed and just used by poor people. Other option is uber. Taxis can be dirty and taxi drivers may smoke and talk on the phone while driving a client . There is no train or metro. So it's cars and people walking in the middle of the road s there are no side walks or zebras. side walks are used for stores, for trees or parking cars. Amman is not a walkble city.   If you have money to spend and just stay around the better areas, you will love Amman.

Unfortunately, there is much wasted potential where historical architecture and intelligent zoning are concerned. I've traveled throughout Brazil and lived in Sao Paulo, and I can attest that POA has the best food hands down. Customer service is top notch, and the shopping is good. Love the vintage stores and antique shops too. Sunsets on the lake are a treasure.   Gauchos are the most ""talkative"" people I've ever met in my life (and I am a world traveler who has lived in other countries). Being chatty isn't a bad thing, but the problem here is that the vast majority of people only talk about THEMSELVES. Oftentimes, non-stop. They don't ask questions about you because they have no interest. It's about showing off where they've eaten, traveled, studied, etc. Even the taxi and Uber drivers behave in this manner. Living in a city full narcissists / braggarts gets draining.  After years of being here, I've arrived at the conclusion that it's cultural (not malicious). Aside from this, they are very nice people.

1705449722,Asia,358980,"Some feedback how Kuching looks like from my perspective these days (because I guess city vibe changed a lot since covid):  Place has a lot of potential but as of right now (mid-2023) it is just OKAY but kind of boring for staying longer than 1 month and having a base here for solo nomads. I was ready to bail after 2 weeks but committed for 1 month anyway  1. SOCIAL/COMMUNITY This was the biggest drawback for me. - There is no any community right now (or is dead by now), I'm not talking only about DN community but also there is no any FB Hiking Group, Board games group, Couchsurfing group etc. - Get ready you won't meet ANY nomads within 1 month even if really trying hard and asking on different FB groups, Slacks etc. - There is barely any couchsurfing travelers. Most people come here for 3-7 days, most of them are couples. Couchsurfing hangout is dead - met only one local girl and she told these days maybe 2 people a month wanna hangout - If you travelling solo you will get bored after 2 weeks. - there are some expats but mostly those are 50/60+ years old retired people and all expats even those younger mostly only active in their inner circles - found it hard to make any friends with locals. Even when starting conversation yourself feels like pulling teeth... - dating apps (tinder/bumble) also not helpful to get someone to have a coffee or lunch - looks like everybody has long covid, depressed or lazy to get out of home and do anything during weekends  2. COWORKINGS There are 2 good coworkings (as a space): thegrounds and icube but:  Shared CONS: - both are mostly empty (most of the time only 1-2 locals in open space, other locals in private offices -> you won't have much interaction with them) - both open only from 8.00-18.00 and closed during weekends. - zero initiative - no any members lunch or trying to make community alive  ==Icube - has WIFI speed only around 10MB/10MB (seems limited per user) - only allow to login to WIFI with one device - it's more far away from oldtown (but no problem if you have motorbike) - hot desk are big NO NO - those are tiny circular desk and plastic chairs that are only OK to have a tea and chitchat - cold desks are good but they have only 13 sits for those - most are rented by locals/companies but not used for 90% of days in a week -> I was only one nomad, place looked empty but still it was the last cold desk I could rent. During my 2 weeks on average there was 1-3 other people in open space  + on the good side cold desk is very cheap and the price per week is pretty much the same -> don't need to commit for 1 month. But I don't like fixed desk -> harder to get to know someone if cowork is mostly empty + downstairs lots of shops for having a lunch + having more startup vibe look  ==The Grounds - freaking cold air-con (had to go with long pants and shoes instead of shorts + flip-flops and still felt cold) + pretty much inside downtown - don't need transport if living nearby + more modern look than icube + have 5 days flexible pass  2. INTERNET I would say overall mobile internet is slow in Kuching. I tried both Digi and Yoodo (by Celcom). Even though speed test was showing 10MB/10MB often everything was very sluggish even when signal was strong (just simple website browsing, restaurant images in google maps, etc.)  3. ACTIVITIES/NATURE - closest beach is ~40min away on motorbike (too far away to randomly each day go to see sunset and it's raining most of the evenings anyway), all beaches are very 'meh' (I though Penang or even Langkawi beach is meh but Kuching was even lower league). Probably not safe to swim (they have warning sign about ""watch out crocodiles"") - even if you busy most of the week you can tick off most places worth to visit within 2 weekends - nothing spectacular, sure there is wildlife center to see orangutans (if you lucky) but that's event only for like 2h - national parks are ok but e.g. bako national park has only 2 routes open (those more interesting are closed) - borneo culture museum or sarawak culture center was ok but nothing mind blowing (and not cheap) + the only thing that I liked is waterfront area during evening, musical fountain and vibe around there.  Now go search instagram for hashtag #Kuching or #sarawak for inspiration -> probably you won't find many interesting spots that are ""must see""  4. WEATHER - at least in whole May was raining a lot! pretty much every day mostly after 17.00 though. Raining is not like raining in thailand or indonesia that after 15-30min it stops and after another 30min everything is dry. When it's raining it will be raining probably for 1-2h minimum. This makes evenings more boring and need to force yourself to get out especially if you are on motorbike  5. COSTS - not easy to find some decent accomodation on AirBnB for $1000 or less. I stayed in Kozi Square (many airbnbs there) for ~$550. Room was ok but tiny but a little better than most average hotels. I recommend to just rent Hotels weekly around waterfront instead  - motorbike for 1 month is around 600 RM but that's semi-automatic, if you want automatic it's 800 RM. Can drive only around Kuching. The semi automatic was very good though (waterproof phone holder, and waterproof storage in the back) + lots of hotel choices for around 20-30$ in downtown so don't have to commit for 1 month  As a rule of thumb cost of living is similar to Penang (though in Kuching accommodation rental cheaper) and around 2-3x of cost in Chiang Mai  6. TIPS a) don't commit for 1 month upfront, better just commit for 2 weeks, see how much you like it or if you click with someone and then decide if worth to stay longer or go to e.g. Sabah instead b) choose accommodation in walking distance to waterfront (oldtown/chinatown). This is where city is most alive in the evening and even if you are 5min away on motorbike like me was, it's still better to be there because often raining and easier to meet some random travelers randomly walking c) this is not Thailand. Many places closes at 15.00 or 17.00. Other only opens at 17.00 but stay open until 22.00. Most places outside of waterfront area will be closed very early (before 18.00). Even most food places around iCube cowork closes before 18.00. The good things is that easier to find place open for breakfast. d) you will probably have better experience if not traveling solo but with partner or travel-mate and co-living (can share nicer flat and car, feeling less boring) e) consider first 2 days staying maybe in some nicer social hostel - at least you can maybe meet some travelers and do something together. Or even maybe renting better single room in some nicer hostel if you are solo nomad (even if it's less comfortable than having own studio/condo) f) many AirBnB places have not good WIFI (because using mobile internet instead of wired) - double check it before renting since remember coworking spaces are only open between 8.00-18.00 and closed during weekends.",kuching-malaysia,kuching,kuching-malaysia,,,56,11200,,,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/kuching-malaysia.jpg?1705449722",古晋,Kuching,马来西亚,59,,1.6077,110.3785,Malaysia,MY,malaysia,,,,25,5,4.222857142857142,88,235,wi-day-rain,🌧,28,82.14,33,91,939,633,501,1753.7044854881265,2.5161251660657826,2.5161251660657826,5,2.1571428571428575,,4

1705276992,Europe,25468,"Lake Balaton is Eastern Europe's treasure, an expansive freshwater lake that offers a medley of activities and experiences for both tourists and the growing nomadic community. But there are a few pointers and oddities that digital nomads, in particular, should be aware of. 🌍 **Neighbourhood Map Inaccuracy**   Firstly, I was quite surprised to find that NomadList's neighbourhood map for Lake Balaton is somewhat inaccurate. For a start, it glaringly omits Siófok, which is probably the largest city by the lake. Siófok isn't just a popular summer destination but an essential point of reference for anyone considering Lake Balaton as a potential remote work destination. 👩‍💻 **Co-working Spaces**   To my knowledge, the region's most notable coworking space is ""AZ iroda - Közösségi Iroda, Coworking Office Balaton"", conveniently located in Balatonfüred. It's a charming, functional space that adds a touch of modernity to the largely traditional locale.  🏖️ **Attractions & Activities**   Lake Balaton has a range of neighbourhoods, each brimming with its unique attractions. Swimming, fishing, and sailing are the staples here, with the lake's calm waters inviting all and sundry. For the thrill-seekers, the hyper jet 800 HP boat tours offer an adrenaline-infused experience of the lake's vastness. As the sun sets, the lakeside towns, each with their distinct character, beckon with their laid-back vibes and scenic views.  📡 **Connectivity**   If you're relying on internet connectivity, here's the deal: Mobile internet speeds are impressive if you're equipped with an EU SIM. However, WiFi in public places, cafes, and hotels can often be disappointingly slow. So, a good cellular data plan would be your best bet. 👩‍💼 **Nomadic Potential**   Despite its charm, Lake Balaton hasn't become a hotspot for digital nomads. Perhaps it's the tranquillity or the seasonal attractions, but it feels more like a place for relaxation and holidays than intense productivity. That said, its serenity, combined with its budding infrastructure, gives it untapped potential. 🕰️ **A Blast From the Past**   A peculiar charm of some parts of Lake Balaton is that they feel as if they've been preserved in amber since 1989. This has both its pros and cons. On the upside, there's an authentic, untouched feel to these places. However, the flip side is that they might lack some modern amenities that digital nomads take for granted. Most people are super friendly, more friendly in ex eastern block countries, however some are still stuck in homo sovieticus mindset. Also there are some tourist traps, beware. **Verdict**: Lake Balaton, with its quaint towns and vast expanses of freshwater, is more of a holiday destination than a digital nomad hotspot. But with a few tweaks and broader awareness, this Hungarian gem could shine brighter in the nomadic world. For now, it remains a delightful secret, ideal for relaxation and short-term stays. ⭐⭐⭐☆☆",lake-balaton-hungary,lake-balaton,lake-balaton-hungary,,,11,2200,,,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/lake-balaton-hungary.jpg?1705276992",巴拉顿湖,Lake Balaton,匈牙利,0,,46.8828471,17.1462252,Hungary,HU,hungary,,,,72,5,5,70,245,wi-day-rain,🌧,16,60.16,16,61,2414,1599,798,2792.5364617308105,2.510035368409377,2.510035368409377,3.9554285714285715,4.842857142857143,,4

1706486644,Latin America,80161,"Lived in Antigua for over a year and I absolutely loved it! It´s called the city of eternal spring because the weather is like a perfect spring day all year round. There are two seasons, rainy and non-rainy but in rainy season (May-Oct) it only rains for 3-4 hours in the afternoon then stops. It makes everything lush and green which is another reason they call it the city of perpetual roses and eternal spring. It´s a small city so very easily to walk and see everything. If you escape the center of Antigua, you have to go see the little Aldeas around like San Juan del Obispo, Santa Maria de Jesus, Ciudad Vieja and San Pedro de las Huertas for a more local experience. In the surrounding areas there´s Hobbitenagno, Santa Catarina Barahona and the Mayan/catholic diety San Simon in San Andres Itzapa. There´s Iximche nearby which are Maya ruins and Antigua is centrally located to go see other breathtaking spots in Guatemala like Lake Atitlan and Monterrico. The local people are incredibly nice in general and especially to tourists. Antigua itself is very safe with it´s own division of tourist police, among local, state and federal police. Internet can be a challenge sometimes but when I was there in 2022 they started installing Fiber Optic Internet by a company called Innova so it was getting a lot better. There are a few co-working places like Selina and others that cater to digital nomads so if the internet isn´t super fast where you are staying there are a handful of places that have you covered and hopefully more soon with fiber optic internet. If you´re looking for history, beauty, nature and a more peaceful way of life, Antigua is your place!

1705536249,North America,3990456,"I spent 4 months working here during summertime. It's one of the best summers I have ever had in my life. The city is just amazing and offers dozens of outdoor activities. There are so many different places such as parks, lakes, hills, mountains, beaches, etc. Also, you can feel the Californication vibe on every step.  I lived in Hollywood and I would avoid this place at any cost. It's just too overrated and won't meet your expectations. Hollywood (esp. West Hollywood) is a big pile of dirtiness with people wandering around. I'd suggest looking for smaller neighborhoods preferably in The Valley. That area is just lovely. Also, anything close to Santa Monica is overwhelming yet too costly.  One of the things I also didn't like was the lack of cultural influence and this is for sure not a city that will offer nice architecture. Another thing I disliked was the huge social distancing towards foreigners which is most likely part of the American culture. If you were to make deeper friendships here, this is not a place to go. You will end up getting ignored and in the worst case, people will stop any contact with you.  Also, the public transport of LA is not reliable especially if you use bus transportation. Get ready to wait a long turn before you get to a bus. I suggest either using the metro or renting a car which is probably the best option in LA. Otherwise, get prepared for long walks throughout your place of stay.  With all of the above said, I will for sure return to this city again and can't say I'm not missing it.

I strongly recommend a guided tour (about $75) because the trails aren't marked well and the guides are full of useful and interesting information. be prepared though, Cuenca is 2500m (8000 feet) up and Cajas is 4000m (13000 feet) up so you'll definitely feel the altitude.

Rent a car for your stay to have a better experience - or get yourself a bike, cuz it has bike lanes everywhere - and bikes for renting on an app if you wish to.  There's a lake with many activities around it, from bars to bike lanes to Hawaiian canoeing, windsurfing, etc. There are many boat rentals around it.

1705708928,Asia,809344,"Have been in Weligama since Feb 25th and now I'm still here with the COVID-19 curfew going on. Before the curfew starts I was eager to get out of here because 1) it's too hot mid-day 2) tuktuk drivers are waiting around every corner asking ""tuktuk?"" and always horn at you when you're walking by the street - super annoying and 3) it's difficult to find workable wifi 4) everything just seemed super slow and it was hard to be productive.  But after the curfew starts I actually like it way better because 1) the traffic noise dies and 2) I found myself a place with good wifi right next to the beach. The locals (besides pushy tuktuk drivers) are very friendly though often times their English is too limited to understand you but they still pretend they understand just to be ""helpful"". It's also a great place for learning to surf (I made some real improvement with my skills).  The nomad cost is not accurate here. Expect similar or slighter lower cost than Chiang Mai, unless you're eating veggie rice and curry every day.  In summary it can be good for living and working if you spend the time to find a place with good wifi or get your own boardband.

Not the MOST exciting city in the world, but certainly a lovely place to stay and take it easy for a couple days or weeks and get some work done. My favorite part of the city was the canals that run through certain parts, they were really pretty and added a lot of character and there were oftentimes bars/restaurants along the water or trails for running/walking/biking. There are a lot of good restaurants and bars, the people were all very friendly, and we had fun going to an area of town called Digbeth one night - it's a very hip area with a lot of bars and of cool graffiti. Not a ton of sights to see, and of course you can expect typical UK prices, but a very nice place never-the-less!

There is quite a bit to do here, and Madison is also close enough to Milwaukee for day trips to explore.  I love the farmers markets and feel very spoiled to have access to so many locales from which to buy organic food (and vegan, paleo, etc.).  What I don't love is the racism in the public schools.  Madison is a fairly segregated city, which has been a huge disappointment.  Over the past three years or so, road rage has become a significant problem and the crime rate has drastically increased.

And still.. you have jungles, beautiful scenery, beautiful sea 5 minutes from your place(!), amazing sunsets, unbelievable variety of food (super cheap!!!), swimming pools, roads ro drive a motorbike without any traffic, super friendly people, place is extremely safe, and... a lot of other perks!

It's no worse than any US coastal city. Maybe even safer.

I think you really need to like drinking to meet people here as there isn't much else to do. - It's definitely a walkable city, but the public transit isn't super useful for an expat/nomad. Ubers are ridiculously cheap anyway and I never had a bad driver. You can get anywhere you need to go for a few dollars. - Climate, at least in winter, is perfect. Not too hot or too cold. Some people don't like how it drops into the 50s at night, but I don't really notice cause I'm a Northerner anyway. Though there are some bad air quality days if you're sensitive to that.  Cons: - If you stay in Colonia Americana or Providencia (and you'll most likely stay in either one of these hoods since they're safe and convenient), it's very yuppy. Yes, Mexico has yuppies. And that's not exactly what I signed up for visiting Mexico. So if you like Brooklyn and ""cool people"", this is the spot... me personally, I like a friendlier and less upper-class crowd. I don't find the people here particularly curious or eager to get to know foreigners even though there aren't that many tourists here compared to other major Mexican locations. It's not unfriendly either, I just think it's fairly townie. - The security culture is pretty intense here. Feels a little over-the-top compared to the relative safety. A lot of ""haves vs. have nots"" kind of vibe here... I don't really like that. I prefer a more egalitarian atmosphere. - Tons of grafitti in the central city. Definitely a lack of respect for private property here.  - Tourist sites are pretty boring if you're here for a short stay. I don't even think it's worth it to visit as a tourist or for only a couple of days. It's a good place to practice Spanish for a month, experience living abroad for the first time, or save some dollars in a place with mostly familiar amenities. - The cost of living is overall low here but Mexico has gotten a lot more expensive than it used to be. I'm not sure it's a great deal anymore. Cheaper than the US, but maybe only 15% cheaper than the cheapest mid-tier Midwest city (like a Columbus).  - The grocery situation isn't great, especially in Colonia Americana. It seems like people eat out all the time. - The best amenities are in the burbs but you probably don't want to live there. I did visit Zapopan and it feels a lot like a US burb. - Very liberal. Again, feels like Brooklyn. If you're not a lefty, this is probably not your city. - I think people drink and party and go to music shows here. If that's not your thing, it's probably going to be hard to meet people here.",guadalajara-mexico,guadalajara,guadalajara-mexico,1,200,279,55800,,24.910873440285204,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/guadalajara-mexico.jpg?1705536089",瓜达拉哈拉,Guadalajara,墨西哥,113,,20.6596988,-103.3496092,Mexico,MX,mexico,,,,78,5,2.4885714285714284,10,383,wi-day-sunny,☀️,28,82.684,25,77,2021,1255,868,3036.3277685329317,2.4082036417658084,2.4082036417658084,4.404571428571428,5,2.5,2

Churches everywhere, bible study groups and people trying to convert you if they see you are a non-believer or of a different faith. Lots of smokers and sus looking people. Lots of jobs, but almost no careers, think service sector. The town is run by the same wealthy white boomers since the 70s. And it's still corrupted like it was in the good old days. Homes are becoming overpriced. Almost all the new construction in the town to accommodate the influx of people has been generic apartments and a series of fast food, car washes, and credit unions. WKU ranks bottom 25% in the nation. It basically a community college with a Panda Express. The school system is mediocre, run by teachers who phone it in. If you're not in AP classes, you're not going have many prospects for post-secondary education. Town basically shuts down around 8-9Pm on weekdays and 11-12 on weekends.

There is a crime problem and people complain about it all the time, but if you choose your neighborhood carefully and lock up your stuff that can mostly be avoided. Fun, sort of weird vibe with a unique culture, fascinating history, and great food. Perfect weather year round with just enough of each season without too much snow or too much heat.  Bosque area or Sandia mountains are great for hiking, easy weekend getaways to New Mexico's  national parks (White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns in particular are fun!) and other areas to explore (blue hole in Santa rosa, Santa Fe, Native american ruins, etc), as well as southern Colorado and Arizona.  Its just a different kind of place than any other city. Good size and decent airport, but doesn't feel huge. Politically somewhat moderate- the north half of the state is liberal and the south and all the Texan transplants are conservative so it lands somewhere in the middle. Generally friendly locals and a nice melting pot of Native American, Mexican, and other cultures without a lot of judginess- very live and let live. And cheaper than almost any other ""big"" city in the USA. I have no idea how anyone chooses to live in Phoenix when the weather is so awful compared to ABQ, or chooses Denver when the cost of living is so high compared to ABQ. And Texas is too humid, so New Mexico is a nice little spot in the middle of all of it.

1705708888,Latin America,1619146,"I've spent the past four months living in Quito, and to be honest, I've decided that I won't be returning to this country again. My experience here has been incredibly frustrating, especially when dealing with the average Ecuadorian citizens. For instance, when you go to a store and ask for a specific item, you often end up with something entirely different. Additionally, using Uber has its challenges, as many drivers keep their phones in their laps, constantly glancing down at the GPS instead of using a phone holder for safety.  While I've always had a love for dogs and grew up with them, my time here in Quito has led me to develop a genuine fear and dislike for them. It's not just the stray dogs causing issues on the streets; it's also the ones owned by people in lower-income areas. Many of these dogs are not properly controlled and have a tendency to randomly attack passersby. I had a particularly distressing encounter with a group of aggressive dogs during my third month here.  Moreover, if you happen to wear shoe sizes above 10 and a half, you'll face difficulties finding suitable footwear, as these sizes are rarely available anywhere in the city.  As for the dating scene, I found it to be quite lackluster, especially as a male. Quito doesn't offer a wide range of activities or a thriving expat culture. Most locals you encounter seem to be interested in forming friendships only to gain something from you.  On a more positive note, I did find some redeeming qualities in Quito, such as the ability to take quick trips to places like Banos and the overall cost of living. However, based on my experiences, I wouldn't recommend living in Quito for an extended period, as it doesn't offer much in terms of a fulfilling experience. You're not missing out on much by choosing to explore other places instead.",quito-ecuador,quito,quito-ecuador,,,260,52000,,64.16666666666666,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/quito-ecuador.jpg?1705708888",基多,Quito,厄瓜多尔,101,,-0.1806532,-78.4678382,Ecuador,EC,ecuador,,,,12,5,2.762857142857143,91,413,wi-day-rain,🌧,16,61.048,16,61,1615,801,600,2099.4062500000005,2.3958082831104557,2.3958082831104557,4.868571428571429,1.4428571428571428,2.5,3

1705622728,Latin America,2196472,"I’ve been to 14 countries across 4 continents and travelled most of the US and I must say Havana is probably the most incredible city I have ever been to but is probably better suited for a vacation than for nomading. It’s not difficult to find wifi as most airbnbs and restaurants have it but it’s not reliable if you have important video conferencing calls or need to constantly stream something.   Since most industries are publicly owned by the government, there’s a deep lack of commercialization that makes this place look so different from what you see in most other countries. Instead of large advertisements and billboards at every turn, there’s rich and beautiful art culture that makes just walking around and exploring this place the streets so enjoyable. Many people say that Havana feels like it’s stuck in the 1950’s which is definitely true since the classic city architecture and the vintage American muscle cars are all so well preserved.   If you admire live music then you are definitely in for a treat as there is usually so many talented musicians and performers at every corner and in most bars/restaurants.  The food is mostly seafood but it’s underwhelming as it lacks flavor. Cuban coffee & rum on the other hand definitely do not disappoint nor do the famous Cuban cigars if you’re into that.  Another huge highlight is the Cuban people. They are truly the warmest and most welcoming of any country that I have been to. Such a diverse community and everyone always a bright smile on their face and are so excited to welcome you to their beautiful country. Knowing Spanish definitely helps but there is usually someone around that speaks English pretty well and can help you if you need.  Yes there are definitely struggles with a lack of certain supplies and some infrastructure challenges but I honestly felt like it made for a more unique experience that I very much enjoyed.  Overall i’d say pros/cons  Pros: Beautiful city to explore Perfect weather Amazing people VERY safe (and not with cops at every corner) Quite affordable  Cons: Unreliable Wifi Underwhelming food Limited resources Need cash for all transactions  It’s probably not up to everyone but it offers a very unique culture and has such an amazing history to learn about.

1705622696,North America,246375,"I live in Saskatoon.  It's brutally cold in the winter--do not visit.  That said, it's cheap and gorgeous in the summer (May to September).  Temperatures usually are between 20 and 30 Celsius during the day, and the sky is almost always clear.  The sunsets are gorgeous, and there is a riverbank corridor that runs through the city where you can walk for 20 kilometres along the river and never cross a street (it's called the Meewasin... If you like nature, you will want to book a place near it).  Bring bug spray, as there are lots of mosquitos in the summer, especially in the evening.  During the summer, there is also a lot more to do--there are often festivals like the jazz festival, the Fringe (theatre), Taste of Saskatchewan, etc.  There is not a ton of nightlife or other things to do--there are a couple of museums and art galleries, but it's a very small town feel.  Like everywhere in Canada, it's generally safe, LGBTQ friendly, and multicultural.  It's safe for minorities, although we have racism like everywhere (and Indigenous people--women in particular--have to be careful walking alone at night).  As a white woman, I have walked anywhere I want at all times of day or evening for my whole life, and not had a problem (although I have a high threshold for risk).  Canadian culture (prairie culture in particular) is polite and kind (you will be helped if you are in trouble) but reserved.  Making friends requires some kind of ""in"" (like attending a mutual event or a shared sport or something like that.

The core of historic Chinatown, in Kesawan district,  is quite the place to shop or eat- there's food, fabric, motorcycles, musical instruments, sports equipment, cell phones (an entire mall for just cell phones).  Medan has a LOT of coffee shops, from little carts on the sidewalk to hipster joints in refurbished buildings (and Starbucks). Like the song by 'Missing Persons' says, ""Nobody Walks in Medan"". The scooter and motorcycle rule the road here.  Watch where you are walking (sidewalks are a bit rough).  Brastagi is the fancy grocery store. Indiatown is wonderful and the restaurant Cahaya Baru is the best Indian food since... well... India. The area was settled by Local Aboriginal Natives, Chinese, and Indians, and there is a great cultural mix with a lot of tolerance today, especially as time moves on from those dark days of the late 1990's Indonesia... out with the old, in with the new...Young people just wanna have fun now. Mosques, temples (Indian, Buddhist, Confucian), churches... Medan really is the most culturally diverse spot in Indonesia.

Food offers a lot of red meat, but it's possible to do a good combination of cheese, bread, salads, and seafood.  WiFi is not the best.  There are a few points in the town that should be seen but mostly Mostar is a service town with nightlife, restaurants, and coffee places. It's quite lovely all of it, but besides it, the town doesn't offer a lot.  However, this part of Bosnia is beautiful and it is possible to see the different places around by staying in Mostar.

Summers are unbearable, but it's possible to be on the sea cost in 45 minutes by car.

1705449846,Latin America,579137,"Although I'm usually in Montego Bay, I always spend at least a week in Kingston whenever I'm in Jamaica. I've been there twice a year since 2017. Despite Montegonians warning me about how dangerous it is, using common sense, respecting the locals and their culture, and not being an asshat, unsurprisingly, goes a long way. I'm not big on tourist traps, but stopping by Devon House is a must. If it isn't for the history of its buildings or the beautiful gardens, stop and get an amazing curry goat patty or amazing ice cream. Accommodation costs vary greatly and I've stayed at both the C$80/night Spanish Dream to $300/night at Spanish Court. Longer term stays would benefit greatly from having a local Kingstonian's assistance. Transportation costs also vary based on the honesty of your taxi driver. Locals are generally friendly and I was lucky to have experienced the nightlife from the club scene to outdoor reggae parties, and local dancehall parties. I've never felt unsafe but I was also always with locals who knew their way around the city. Food is amazing and pricing varies greatly as well.

1705449893,Europe,101000,"Many people get the wrong idea about this city because they don't know where to go or stay at a touristy place. It's one of the best cities for me personally to live in (decided to move here full-time). If you still want to live in a city with it's amenities, but want to have the ability to run to nature within 10-20 minutes, this might be it for you. Yes, it's not cheap, and I would put Limassol into the exact cost of living brackets as Lisbon or Berlin. For long-term living, the costs are much lower because of lower local taxes (12.5% for freelancers and companies), while Germany has a 45% tax an example. Another main con is public transportation, hence you need to rent a car to experience the real Cyprus.  Pros: - Perfect for work/life balance (for me) - Beaches are in and around the city, you live in the middle of the island, so Troodos mountains, white sandy beaches of Ayia Napa, other cities (Paphos, Larnaca) are just a 1h drive away. - Rapidly growing and improving. A completely different experience from 5/10 years ago. Lots of great coffee shops to work from and improving internet connection (most coffee shops have good enough internet). - Some of the friendliest locals I've seen. On and they all speak English - The weather is great 95% of the time. August is too hot for most people and January/February can be too cold or rainy (15-20 C) compared to alternatives such as Asia - Nightlife improved drastically in the last few years with cool bars, nightclubs, tech/house or techno music, day parties, restaurants that have djs playing chill music and so on. - Very safe - Cyprus has this charming ""villagy"" vibe that Greece and other southern countries have, so don't expect to find Bangkok here:)   Cons: - Getting more expensive here (Berlin level). Other cities in Cyprus are much cheaper. If you live here as a resident tax savings cover for it. - Lack of public transportation. You need to rent a car to get around the places (Limassol is a very ""long"" city, so going from one point to another might take awhile). - Limassol still has some abandoned or not clean buildings that you could find in other Middle Eastern countries, but don't let that fool you. - This is not a con to me (even though I don't speak Russian/Ukranian/Belarussian): There is quite a community of Belarussians, Russians and Ukrainians fleeing the war, but most of the ones I met are super friendly and very nice. If you really don't like hearing Slavic languages, most of the nice bars and restaurants have mainly locals, Greeks or Europeans. Almost all of them are very friendly and come from amazing cities like Kiev.

The same people you'd see in Ubud or Koh Pha Ngan or Goa, you'll see in Graz. Speaking of the people, they're nice, but they won't smile at you in public mostly. I also wouldn't say it's easy to meet people here, but that's probably Austrian culture. Everyone already got their cliques.  Oh one annoying thing, eveeeeeryone smokes here or that's how it feels like. You won't be able to sit anywhere outside without getting smoke in your face.  In terms of activities, you can do quite a lot of hiking/walking around Graz in the hills and mountains. It's really beautiful if you just walk half an hour north east which we did.  A nice place to work is Martin Auer, they have a few diff spots around town, really AMAZING coffee and baguette sandwhiches there, you won't believe how good.

The juxtaposition of old and new, rich and poor, high-end retail and street fare was something to see.  Apparently one of the cheapest places to rent in India, although I fell back on a hotel (I know, not very nomad)....  Still, it was not bad. Internet was fast enough for research and posting work, but there are filters on access in various places in India, so for example I couldn't get my Tunnel to function here (may have just been my chosen access points filtered it).  There are internet cafes (Starbucks, etc) in the Park Street area that I could use. English is widely (but NOT universally) understood, but you will also run up against Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu. The food is fabulous, with every possibility you can imagine (oh yeah, nice brewpubs and pizza for the unadventurous).  Even if you are not a vegetarian, trust me, these folks can cook in ways that you won't miss meat (and this from a guy who likes BBQ). Currency exchange is best done at a bank, don't trust the ATM's that are stuck to the side of a building. Although the NomadList says otherwise, I was able to use my plastic for a lot of purchases- India is pretty progressive depending on where you are.  Use a ""Prepaid taxi"" to get from the airport to town, which you can get from a booth inside the main terminal...

Although the city is pretty small (less than 1 million) it's a good point to see Bolivia and area, it has great culture to explore there are comfortable buses going to Uyuni and other places in Bolivia, so it's a good point to see other parts of Bolivia. Especially that staying in the city gets one accustomed to the altitude. It's both amazing city and the country and makes for a memorable stay.

Being smaller it helps you stay focused, spend less time travelling around etc.   I personally have never felt unsafe there and pretty much all the nomads I meet there say the same.   Power is much more stable than 7 years ago, for me it's never really been an issue.  Interenet to the island is usually 300-400mbps up/down for anywhere with a good router/wifi.

Also much more difficult than in Rio to stumble into a bad neighbourhood. Lived here for 6 years and never had any problems. I walk and bike everywhere and never felt threatened. Pretty beaches and great access to nature. Good restaurantes, coffee shops, and nightlife. Short on musuems, football games, and big time tourist attractions (although the convent in neighbouring Vila Velha is really spectacular) if that is your thing. Not a huge expat community, but local people are very freindly. Live in Praia do Canto, Jardim da Penha, Jardim Camburi, Enseada do Sua, or across the bridge in Praia da Costa.

Much lower than shopping at Whole Foods and probably by now, even Trader Joes.   Eating out, well, it can cost you a lot but there are so many affordable options. Rents can be high but again, there are many apartments that are reasonable if you are renting year-round. We have been renting Airbnb's during the winter months, from October to February, and were able to get a beautiful sea view one-bedroom for $1200. Another AirBnb a bit higher up again, for $1200. We splurged on a place with a large terrace and beautiful mountain view for $2300. But it was worth it! $2300 was about what my mortgage was in Chicago. According to Numbeo, cost of living here is around $4100 for a family of four.  By the way, Cannes is gorgeous with a sandy, accessible beach, people are very friendly, and it is meticulously maintained. We have been to Aix-en-Provence, Marseilles, Montpellier, Nice, Bordeaux and of course Paris, but have chosen Cannes to live.

I have no idea why they’re saying it’s dangerous. There’s literally cops putting bike traps up to tempt people into stealing because there’s so little crime. It’s incredibly safe and welcoming to people of all races & genders.  It’s also dry, incredibly dry with forest fires in the summer so the smoke can be intense for several months. It’s not rainy at all like the weather on here states. It appears the map & hospital are linked to another Ashland not in Oregon. The photo is however of Ashland, Oregon.   Ashland is very white bread. There’s essentially no people of color or ethnicity. It’s comprised of people who took to spirituality instead of psychotherapy to work out their issues so there’s a fair amount of spiritual arrogance. There’s an infinite amount of spiritual workshops & endeavors.   The town survives off of tourism & weed. It’s often joked that there’s 3 women to every man. I don’t know if that’s accurate though it feels like it. Almost all married couples who move here divorce. It’s an incredibly healing place for women, but not a place for relationship as most remain perpetually single here. It’s the single mom capital of the US.

Don't get me wrong, it's lovely and exotic, and people are warm and welcoming, but it can get pretty boring after 30 days.    Cost of living is NOT cheap. Groceries are much more expensive than in any other places we've travelled to in the last two years. Restaurants are all the same price (around 30€ for 2 people) and pretty much serve the same thing. Food variety is not great.  If you come here for surfing, the waves are inconsistent at best and, at worst, non-existent.   On paper, it seems like a nice idea. In reality, it feels like locals and the government hired good marketers to sell the destination to digital nomads.   On the bright side, we had stable internet and it was sunny EVERY day.

Almost all restaurants have typical ski resort offers for all the British you will find here. Yes, tons of them come for vacations and the resort gets so crowded that even in the best days only a couple of hours have good enough conditions. And that’s if you can make it in the first hours. Even the “fast line” gets packed with tourists with “vip tickets” bought from some hotels and agencies. Long waiting hours await you not only in the gondola but almost every lift.  People are unfriendly, service is bad. You’re supposed to pay for a coworking to be involved in any social event. The “coworking Bansko” cult led by its weird founder is specially known for being extra exclusive and unfriendly with people outside of the coworking space.  The gyms are small and only one has good enough quality. It’s cheap, but it gets crowded easily due to its small size and limited capabilities. You won’t be able to workout properly if you want to do advance stuff.

It's an imposing place and not the most welcoming, but that's because it takes time to adjust. In a nutshell: beautiful parks, very modern infrastructure , friendly people, good transportation (the subway is FAR superior to London or NYC, for example), amazing food, relatively cheap, extremely safe, loads to do, incredible history. The one major con is the air pollution—it can get really bad, so beware. Throughout my time in Beijing, I was constantly discovering new places and meeting interesting people. When I was there, there were plenty of foreigners and people were mostly very welcoming towards us. It's a special place. There are also loads of cafes and bars where you can work from, with good internet. A must-visit is the Friends Cafe—it's modelled after Central Perk from the sitcom Friends. They have good internet, delicious coffee and snacks, and Friends is playing on the TV 24/7!

Very few cafés/restaurants/bars/museums/etc. Therefore it'll also be hard to make friends and connections. As with the rest of Norway, it's very expensive. The public transport is limited. The pros: Art Noveau architecture and lots of green areas, generally very safe city regardless of neighborhood. I'd recommend stopping by for a few days (a week tops) if you're in Norway anyway, but I would not recommend moving here for an extended period of time.

1644279060,Africa,1747152,"Lusaka is a bustling city full of surprises if you look. The downside is rent is on the pricey side than say what you would expect to pay in most places in SEA. You can find some low rental places but then you'd be putting yourself in an environment that's not particularly safe. I'd pick a neighbourhood like Kabulonga, Woodlands, Chilenje, Ibex Hill or Makeni. Getting around is easier if you have a car or find a reliable cabby. You can also use the local rideshare app called Ulendo Taxi, it works well and even has female drivers, which I think is great for solo female travellers. Public safety is okay, best not to travel to compounds where safety can be a major issue, especially if you're a muzungu, a local word for 'White person' or someone considered well-off. Expect to be crowded around by street vendors selling everything from phone accessories, clothing, and sometimes local crafts. I wouldn't advise purchasing from these as you'll get ripped off - best go to the weekend markets or the craft village.  Zambia doesn't have a café or coffee culture per se but you can find some pretty decent coffee shops that have great coffee and free wifi. Zam Bean Coffee, The Corner Café and 3Tree's are my favs. I'd advise to join the Expat Group's on Facebook for more tips and questions.

Most people have never seen a foreigner and are very happy to be your friend.   They'll never ask anything of you and actually, will want to pay EVERYTHING for you. Your drinks, your food... no way a Pakistani is gonna let you pay.   Lahore is an amazing town with lots to discover and an amazing culture.

I walked a lot around town, and it was perfectly safe. There are even some pedestrian zones with no traffic. Erlangen should have a really high score in this category- it's not exactly a big town where getting around on foot just isn't reasonable. You can alternatively ride a bike pretty much anywhere. Getting in and around town is also possible with public transport - trains and buses which are reliable, affordable, and convenient.  Also, it was super easy to make friends... if you make an effort. If you walk around being very loud and drawing attention to yourself, locals will shy away from you. Once you make an effort to meet locals, there is plenty to do. It's not a touristy town so it's easy to miss all the fun that's available. If you happen to be in Erlangen during the annual Bergfest (the 3rd largest beer festival in all of Germany), you're in for a real treat.

There are many students here and a rich culture of Alsatian, German and French cultures interwoven.  The orange park is a fantastic place to walk, relax and picnic.

Think that  Italy is the only country in the world where each region produce a different kind of wine with different kind of local grapes. It is a real bless for palate. Italians are friendly and locals even more. Almost everybody speaks English here. I am a women and I consider the place to be  a Women safe place. Moreover, Firenze and Tuscany are LGBTQ+ friendly: just remember that the first worldwide  riot aimed to fight in  favor of  the Gay Community happened in Florence almost 500 years ago with the Medici's!  As most part of Europe, Winter is cool and windy but Spring, Summer and Fall are the best period ever! During the Pandemic, the Tuscan hospitals have demostrated to be over the top of their expectations  to face  both the emergency and   the daily care. In Italy, health care at  hospital  is FREE  for everybody,  foreigners included. Just to recap: food and wine are simply amazing and born to satisfy all palates in particular also veggie and vegan, art  and  nature are all around you, the region is really  safe, nightlife is cool, so I think  it is high time to pack your bags! I really recommend it. Just Enjoy Firenze which is also a great place for a workaction away from your home and your office!

1705796028,Europe,155919,"Brighton has some obvious positives.   It has a beach, it's one hour from London and the UK's 2 biggest airports. It's one of the few UK places outside of London which has a considerable cultural/creative scene.  Unfortunately, the city has a massive problem with street-sleeping, begging and drugs (Many street people from the rest of the UK relocate to Brighton).  It's difficult to spend an hour walking through the town centre without being harassed. In my 6 months living there, my apartment (in a 'posh'  area) was broken into twice at night.  The city is expensive. Affordable if you are on a London salary & commuting - otherwise it's not worth it.

1709683870,Africa,1907479,"I lived for 2.5 months in Kumbo, hours outside of Doula, in summer (their winter) 2009, doing feminist humanitarian aid work. If I could go back in time, I never would have gone as I developed chronic fatigue syndrome for 4.5 years starting during this trip, due to overvaccinating (several tropical diseases injected into me in a short time), the Malarone effects, poor diet, stress, etc. I stopped by Doula for a one night stay both when I arrived and when I left. Do not give men at the airport money. Don't let anyone handle your suitcases. Guys came out wearing (fake) uniforms, then repeatedly demanded money from me. I eventually told them in French to ""leave me alone,"" which worked, but the cab drivers took my luggage even though I told them I was waiting for the hotel to pick me up (hotels should do this, I used Ibis and it was very clean and comfortable, with hot water). The woman working at Ibis told me not to go outside at all, even during the day. (I was traveling alone.) An activist I met in Kumbo said they knew someone who was robbed at knife point at 11 a.m. in Doula. I had black stuff coming out of my nose after the bus ride through town from the pollution being so bad. The airport demanded more money when I returned, and I honestly couldn't tell if it was legit, the guy kept insisting and they even had a booth. Living in Kumbo, I was one of only about 10 white people I saw the entire time I was in Cameroon. It took three days to travel between there and Doula. I felt much more comfortable in the small town, but was often lectured by older men about not greeting properly (once said ""hey"" to my friend and he berated me for being so casual until I started crying). I had stomach spasms from eating and developed a rash from the dirty water (though there are clean water sources, I just chose to use the shower instead of a bucket). I spoke French in Doula and English in the Northwest region, I'm not sure if many people speak English in Doula or not. I met people who'd gotten malaria while staying in Cameroon, and people waited to take malaria pills till after they got sick, since it's the same pill (which is what I'd do in hindsight). Overall, it was the most culture shock I've ever had and a very challenging experience. As far as I know, people only traveled there to help social causes like I was (the Peacecorps has a presence), not for tourism. I'm not sure how it is now, but in 2009, I had to go to a (pretty slow) internet cafe, didn't have internet at home (though I believe they had it in the Doula Ibis hotel), and there were days-long electricity outages.

Baoding has a great shopping mall (Wanbo Square) that has any kind of food you could want. Realistically, you could stay in a great hotel for somewhat cheap for a couple months at a time. You could also choose to stay in an AirBnb as many of the apartments are relatively new and clean on the inside-- but as with all individual lodgings, as with all private residences in China, as a foreigner you MUST register with the local police within a day of arrival. I've never experienced any trouble with Baoding law enforcement while registering.

1709856496,Asia,1538681,"I work in Fukuoka and all I can say is that it's a fantastic city. As a disclaimer I happen to be close to fluent in Japanese, and as the metrics here would indicate speaking next to no Japanese might be somewhat difficult, but it's certainly still livable (tons of signage is in English, and there is information on places to go and see in English as well). Also it feels a tad more unexposed in comparison to some of the more major cities, though Fukuoka has a pretty large population at about 1.6 million inhabitants. I find it incredibly affordable (but I hail from NYC), and there is a lot of green space in close proximity to urban areas, which gives the city this really organic feeling to it- the perfect mix of big and small city. Food is without a doubt exceptional. Incredibly rich culinary history and culture here. Coffee is also terrific (may I recommend ManuCoffee? I used to work in a coffee start up and I still think Manucoffee makes one of the best blends I've had the pleasure to drink in a while). As another reviewer stated, these low key coffee places are often optimal for getting work done/studying/etc. and I often frequent them for this reason. I would say of the major Japanese cities is certainly one of the most livable, and with an airport 15 minutes away from the city center by subway it's very accessible and you can quite easily get around to different parts of the country from there.   As for cons summers here are quite tough. Brutally humid and hot. Winters then get quite cold, but there's rarely snow.   I remember the first time I came here I was visiting as a tourist but even as I work from here the same mellow, free feeling predominates. Lovely, lovely, lovely city.

The city has a good range of things to keep you interested, and the nature nearby is also pleasant.

I would recommend staying in either Aarhus Ø or Frederiksbjerg if you could choose any neighbourhood, though those are also the most desirable ones so the competition for places is high haha.

I came to spend a month in February 2024 and it was amazing! Everyday I got impressed by how nice this city feels. I've been in every latam country apart from Venezuela. Santiago is for sure one of the best. The city is very developed, clean and organized at the same time has a lot of shops, nice architecture, museums, bars and places with a soul. It's safer than most Latam countries and the quality of life is very high (also better than in all of the latam countries). It's not expensive, I'd actually place it as cheaper than most (it's for sure cheaper than Brazil, Medellin, groceries are cheaper than most of the latam countries, uber probably more expensive). The city has a very good metro line, bike itau rentals, allowing you to go everywhere and is very walkable and bikeable, lots of parks and nice streets. There are also many places that you can visit around the city, with 1 hour to the nice beaches and 1 hour to nice mountains. About the common thing in those reviews ""boring"" - every big city needs to be discovered, one needs to learn where to go out, which park is nice etc. Santiago is no different than that. Once you learn how to manouver it, it becomes very lively and exciting. Some examples of party areas are: Manuel Montt, Lastaria (bars), Bellas Artes. The digital nomad scene is not very big compared to e.g. Buenos Aires or Medellin, but does it mean that's a bad thing? Sometimes it's even better because it's easier to make friends in 10 person groups than 200 drunk people groups.

1710029382,Latin America,7366,"Bocas del Toro is an awesome place to come and work at. There are different places to stay and work in Bocas del Toro, throughout the archipelago that offer different experiences. Some places are more remote with high speed internet service, comfortable settings just a bit far so getting into town and enjoying the nightlife can be more difficult. If you want to stay in town there are some options in Bocas Town with co-working spaces like Selinas Hostel, but keep in mind there is a lively nightlife there, so this is great for meeting people but maybe not the best for a quiet night. Some places out of town are Saigon Bay just a few minutes outside of of the center of town. There you can find some quiet bed and breakfasts offering longer term rental options as well as vacation rentals and Airbnbs. Some nice options over Saigon Bay include: Over Water Rentals, Saigon Bay Bed & Breakfast and Barrbara Bed and Breakfast. Further out towards Bluff Beach there are some super cute options like Somewhere or Nowhere, as well as Nomad Tree Lodge, Hummingbird Bed and Breakfast as well as other super cute Airbnbs, keep in mind the further out you are, the higher the chances of having bad internet connection are. Make sure to ask about their internet provider, there are some really good ones that work even in remote areas of Bocas.  Lots of restaurants and cafes offer comfortable places to work as well with great internet and excellent dishes and coffees. Try places such as Cafe del Mar, Super Gourmet, and Buena Vista Restaurante.  Nightlife and activities are abundant. You will never be bored in Bocas del Toro. After working, enjoy activities such as surfing, bike riding, explore the beaches and reefs, for paddling, go sailing, etc. You can also learn Spanish, look for Habla Ya Spanish Schools they have some great longer term programs.

There's a well equipped gym, Salsa dancing Night every Monday at the schick-kitsch mexican restaurant, stand up paddle, lots of wonderful yoga shalas, kite surfing, snorkelling, diving and lots of food options. It's actually becoming a vegetarian and vegan paradise lately. There's also a co-working space as part of a Yoga Center. Several music and traditional festivals are held every year and it's wonderful to watch local weddings. Land prices are also still reasonable given that the island will be developing at a faster pace now. The quality of people that seem to crowd Gili Air are very different to those that go to Gili Trawangan. Gili Air attracts a 30+ couples, families and friends groups who don't mind splashing out on nice accommodation, spa treatments and great culinary experiences. All in all, my favorite place so far with an average of 322 days of sunshine!

1705795668,Europe,1000000,"Although I would not praise Cologne as the top destination for digital nomads I have certain doubts about some negative aspects listed here.   Hospitals: How can hospitals be pretty bad if Germany has one of the best medical systems in the world? This judgments compares it with remote 3rd world cities which is by definition not logical. Germany, and therefore also Cologne, has most likely the best emergency system in the world (ambulance must arrive within max. 12 minutes - independent of traffic) and no one will ask ""who pays"" when you have a serious illness/accident. Doctors have a high education as well (you have to be part of the top 5% of high school to enter a medical study).  Cold in winter: Well, it is not a tropical country. However, snow is rarely. Temperature during days drops below zero on maximum 20 days a year. Surely it is not the most sunny place on earth, but ""very cold"" is definitely elsewhere.  Friends: Cologne is the city of carnival. From November to February you will find parties every day and meet people. Surely, friends are made elsewhere, but at least you will not be alone drinking your Kölsch at the bar. ""Bar talks"" with strangers are common. Share your number and see what happens. Besides this, Cologne has a tradition of clubs (football club, tennis club, carnival club...). If you want to find friends, you must integrate and do such things as well. Then you find plenty of cool people.

1705623144,North America,65185.5,Born and raised 1 hour from Daytona Beach. Pros - Beach is nice. The sand is so packed down you and bike up the beach. You can drive onto the beach and snag wifi from local hotels work in your van. There are a few decent coffee shops. Some nice Diners and local farmers markets depending on the day. If you have a paddle board or kayak there are plenty of players to pop it in the river or sea. The Cons: Unless you're into Nascar and Motorcycles there isn't too much to do after the sun goes down other than a local bar. For longer stays it can get a little quiet and slow. I look forward to if / when this area shifts into more of an entrepreneur vibe. ,daytona-beach-fl-united-states,daytona-beach,daytona-beach-fl-united-states,,,18,3600,,,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/daytona-beach-fl-united-states.jpg?1705623144",代托纳海滩,Daytona Beach,美国,0,,29,-81,United States,US,united-states,FL,,FL,45,5,5,87,1174,wi-day-cloudy,🌥,24,75.652,24,75,6610,3559,1559,5455.9375,1.9882768708317018,1.9882768708317018,1,3.3214285714285716,,3.5

1705968934,Latin America,5854000,"Just spent almost two weeks here after a two week stay in SMA.  This is a very pretty town, but 2 weeks is too long (3 days max if you just want to vacation).  There are many many steps and hills, so walking is the best way to get around.  I felt safe in the tourist areas, but with many narrow passageways, be careful if you are alone.  There is a lot of dogs barking at all hours that echo due to this area being a valley.  There is very little green space.  Also, not sure if there was some recent protests, but we saw a lot of graffiti on historical sites and the staff works every day to scrub it off.   I’m ok with protesting, but to vandalize historical builds is just sad.  One positive, accommodations are cheaper than SMA and CDMX, however, food is more expensive than CDMX.  Btw, the mummy museum, it’s more of a spectacle that is kinda sad and disrespectful, in my opinion.  It could have been much better had it been educational.  Finally, don’t be alarmed if you hear random cannon-like fires as they are just ritual procedures.  It sounds like an invasion and it is mixed in with fireworks and firecrackers.  They happen randomly at random times and days.

1705450551,Latin America,20000,"Hello to everyone ! 🤟  I'm Seb Fourault , entrepreneur and digital nomad who has made Guadeloupe my place of life, as well as my entrepreneurial playground.  I want to share with you my experience and my discoveries on this magnificent island, which I see as a true paradise for all entrepreneurs and digital nomads from around the world.  Guadeloupe, with its idyllic climate, its rich culture and its strategic proximity to Europe and America, offers an exceptional living and working environment. Here, I found the perfect balance between work, leisure and discovery, in a stimulating and welcoming environment.  In this guide, I will tell you about everything you need to know to succeed as an entrepreneur or digital nomad in Guadeloupe: from the economic climate to available subsidies , including incubators , coworking spaces , and of course, the cultural and social aspects that make this island unique.  My objective ? Convince you that Guadeloupe is not just a holiday destination, but a real hub for entrepreneurs and digital nomads, comparable to places like Dubai, Bali or Thailand , with a unique French touch 🇫🇷  So, ready to dive into the Guadeloupean adventure? Follow me, and let's find out together how to make this island your next office paradise!  PS: This article is the fruit of my personal experience and information collected during my adventures in Guadeloupe, it is of course not an absolute truth and I do not claim that it covers all aspects. It will evolve as I discover, meet and receive your feedback. I hope it will be useful and inspiring to you! 😊  In the program : Guadeloupe, an Eden for Digital Entrepreneurs Understanding the Economic Climate in Guadeloupe Moving to Guadeloupe: Practical Aspects Subsidies and Support for Entrepreneurs Networks and Communities for Entrepreneurs in Guadeloupe Life in Guadeloupe: An Ideal Working Climate My Personal Tips on the Specificities of Guadeloupe  Guadeloupe, an Eden for Digital Entrepreneurs Guadeloupe is much more than a postcard of beaches and palm trees. It is a dynamic ecosystem, conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship. Let me tell you why this island is a top choice for digital entrepreneurs.  Climate and Environment: Imagine working with a view of the Caribbean Sea, surrounded by lush nature. Guadeloupe offers a pleasant tropical climate all year round, similar to Bali or Thailand, but with a major advantage: the stability and security of a French department.  Cultural Diversity and Strategic Proximity: Here you benefit from a unique blend of Caribbean and European cultures. Proximity to Europe and North America is a major advantage for business, especially with direct flights from the United States significantly reducing travel time.  An Innovation Hub: Guadeloupe is not left out in terms of technology and innovation. With local initiatives and support from the French government, the island is positioning itself as a growing technology hub.  In short, Guadeloupe offers an exceptional living environment, combined with a stimulating business environment. It is fertile ground for digital entrepreneurs looking to combine quality of life and professional opportunities.   Understanding the Economic Climate in Guadeloupe As an entrepreneur who took his first steps in Guadeloupe, I can assure you that the island's economy is as rich as its biodiversity. Here's a look at what you need to know about the local economic climate.  A Diversified Economy: Guadeloupe is not limited to tourism. Agriculture, renewable energy, and information technology are booming sectors. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Islands of Guadeloupe (CCI IG), among others, offers support to entrepreneurs.  Government Support: As a French department, Guadeloupe benefits from subsidies and support from the French state, particularly for new businesses and innovative projects. This includes financial aid as offered by BPI France , advice on business creation, and professional training.  A Dynamic Market on an advantageous Geographical location: The local population is receptive and demanding new technologies and innovations. Additionally, the island's geographic position provides easy access to American and European markets.  Time difference, an advantage? Most digital nomads who choose to emigrate to Asia complain that their clients in mainland France call on them until late in the evening, pushing them to work long days.  Here we are positioned in the other direction, we tend to get up a little earlier, which is not disturbing because the sun rises early, and from midday we are quiet and we can work without distraction because the metropolis has gone to bed (or go and enjoy the beach, your choice 😁).  Personally, I find it a real comfort for work/life balance and mental workload.  Challenges to Face: Like any region, Guadeloupe has its challenges, particularly in terms of logistics and infrastructure (water, ecology, energy, transport, access to care, etc.). However, these challenges also represent opportunities for resourceful entrepreneurs.  In summary, Guadeloupe offers a dynamic and diverse economic environment, with significant support for entrepreneurs. It’s fertile ground for those looking to innovate and grow in a tropical setting. To find out more: the CCI website .  Moving to Guadeloupe: Practical Aspects Moving to Guadeloupe as an entrepreneur or digital nomad requires good preparation. Here are some practical tips based on my personal experience and information gathered during my meetings.  Administrative Formalities: As a French department, Guadeloupe follows the same administrative rules as mainland France. For EU citizens, installation is relatively simple, especially for healthcare professionals. For others, a visa may be necessary. It is important to contact the nearest French embassy or consulate to find out the specific procedures.  Accommodation: Finding accommodation in Guadeloupe can be a challenge, especially during peak tourist season. Villa rentals are popular among expats and digital nomads.  The best is to favor local agencies like ZeWelcome rather than Airbnb or Booking , because you do not pay service fees and therefore you save between 15% and 20% on the price of your rental 👌  The districts of Gosier, Sainte-Anne , and Saint-François are very popular for their proximity to beaches and amenities. Furthermore, many companies are based in Jarry, which makes Gosier and Petit-Bourg attractive cities for their proximity to the workplace.  When we arrived with my girlfriend, we rented a villa for 1 month, just to discover the island and find out better where we wanted to settle.  Internet connection: Connectivity is essential for digital nomads. Guadeloupe offers good internet coverage, with fiber optic options in urban areas: Baie-Mahault, Les Abymes, Le Gosier, Le Moule, Sainte-Rose, Le Lamentin, Capesterre-Belle-Eau, Morne à l'Eau , Saint-Claude, Trois-Rivières, Guava, Gourbeyre, Vieux-Fort.  In more remote areas, you will have to make do with ADSL but I assure you it works quite well.  Transport: Having a car is almost essential in Guadeloupe to explore the island and go to professional meetings. Look on LeBonCoin or turn to professionals. Car rental is a convenient option, with many services available at the airport and in major cities.  Luggage and moving: If you plan to settle in for the long term, a viable option may be to bring your car from the mainland. You put all your luggage in it and you rent a container which is transported to Guadeloupe by boat.  In summary, settling in Guadeloupe requires a certain amount of organization, but once there, the quality of life and professional opportunities more than compensate for the initial efforts.  Networks and Communities for Entrepreneurs in Guadeloupe Guadeloupe offers a dynamic entrepreneurial ecosystem, but with a particularity: many circles of entrepreneurs operate privately 😬, which can represent a challenge for newcomers. Here are some concrete ways to integrate into these networks:  Private Groups and WhatsApp: Groups like “Entrepreneurs Solidaires”, initiated by Julien Amodeo of Tech in Caraibes ( LinkedIn ), or “Les amis du Spot” created by entrepreneur Jordan Succar ( LinkedIn ) are examples of these private circles. It is essential to actively solicit addition to these groups, often through LinkedIn or other professional contacts.  GuadeloupeTech: This association regularly organizes networking events and meetings around digital technology and entrepreneurship. It's a great way to meet other professionals and stay up to date with the latest trends.  ZeBox Events: The ZeBox community, with talented organizers like Camille Pourret and Fatoumata Issa-Alzouma ( Camille's LinkedIn , Fatoumata's LinkedIn ), frequently organizes entrepreneurship-related events. These events are golden opportunities to expand your network and gain inspiration from other entrepreneurs.  ZeBox Incubator Guadeloupe The ZeBox incubator in Guadeloupe Incubators: Le Village by CA Guadeloupe ( LinkedIn ) and ZeBox, the CMA-CGM incubator ( Website ), are key incubators offering valuable support to startups.  Coworking Spaces: In addition to ZeBox, which offers monthly packages for members of its network, other spaces such as Iresa, CoWinner, Le Fort Coworking Social Hub, and Level Up Pli Wô offer suitable and conducive working environments. to networking ( EWAG article ).  Integrating into the Guadeloupean entrepreneurial environment requires a proactive approach. It is crucial to be open, actively participate in local events and seek entry into these private groups to successfully integrate.  Life in Guadeloupe: An Ideal Working Climate Guadeloupe offers an exceptional living environment that combines work and pleasure. Here are concrete examples for each aspect of life on the island:  Tropical Climate: Imagine starting your work day with a view of the Caribbean Sea, a mild and sunny climate all year round. I am writing these words to you from my terrace at Le Gosier, with a light breeze which makes working outdoors pleasant even in the middle of the day 😊  Activities and Leisure: After a productive day, there is nothing like a hike in the Guadeloupe National Park, exploring the tropical forest and discovering hidden waterfalls. For diving enthusiasts, the waters around Pigeon Island offer spectacular dive sites, perfect for unwinding on the weekend.  Vibrant Community: Guadeloupean culture is rich and welcoming. I had the opportunity to participate in the Guadeloupe Carnival, a colorful festival that celebrates local culture with music, dance and traditional costumes. It's a great way to immerse yourself in the community and build connections. “Chanté Nwèl” are also a must at Christmas!  Accessibility: Guadeloupe is well served by direct flights from Paris, New York, and other major cities, this accessibility facilitates business travel. The Guadeloupe archipelago is surrounded by small islands where time stops for a weekend: Marie-Galante, Les Saintes, La Désirade.  It's also incredible to take a getaway to other Caribbean islands , such as Dominica (2 hours by boat), Martinique (4 hours by boat or 30 minutes by plane), or even catamaran cruises to Antigua -Barbuda, or Saint Vincent & The Grenadines 😎  A-detailed-and-accurate-illustrative-map-of-Guadeloupe-and-its-surrounding-islands-closely Safety and Quality of Life: Living in Guadeloupe also means benefiting from a safe environment and quality public services, with developed health infrastructures, and administrative services similar to those offered in mainland France (try to anticipate everything similarly, time passes differently here).  In summary, Guadeloupe is not only a place of business opportunities, it is a true paradise for those seeking to combine work and quality of life.  My Personal Tips on the Specificities of Guadeloupe Ah, Guadeloupe! A paradise for entrepreneurs, but with its little particularities 😅  👉 Here are my personal tips , with a touch of humor, for navigating this unique world:  1. Waze > Google Maps: Forget Google Maps for your journeys. Here, Waze is king! He knows every shortcut and avoids traffic jams better than a local.  2. Check Business Hours: If Google says a business is open, take it with a grain of salt. Online timetables? More mythical than real. A word of advice: call before you travel.  3. WhatsApp and Insta, the New Kings: SMS, LinkedIn, Facebook Messenger? It's from the past. Here, everything happens on WhatsApp or Instagram. Get ready to become a voicemail pro.  personal tips and peculiarities of life in Guadeloupe. 4. The Handshake, Key to Business: In Guadeloupe, business is done face to face, with a good handshake. Forget video calls to close a deal, here we rely on human contact.  5. Alternative Services: No Uber, Vinted or Amazon? Do not panic. This is the perfect opportunity to discover local alternatives or even launch your own business in a less saturated market.  👉 Local alternatives to known services:  Deliveroo → EasyTaVie / Please Uber → En Woute / Coco Veepee → Island Deal / Foodiles Le Bonbon → Travel Art Caribbean / Kkfèt Blablacar → Karos SeLoger → Domimmo / LeBonCoin Meetup → Instagram Le Bon Coin → The “Gwada Connexion” Facebook group Google → Ask your neighbor, they will probably know more than Google 😅 6. Speak Creole: Learn the expressions above all. It's cool, it shows your interest in local culture and it opens doors.  My favorite: “Sé grenn diri ka fé sak diri”, it’s the grain of rice that makes the bag of rice, which could be translated into “small streams make long rivers”.   7. Understand Local History: Visit the ACTe Memorial and pick up a book on the history of Guadeloupe. Understanding Guadeloupe's colonial and cultural past is essential to truly grasp the soul of the island and its people.  8. Import and Adapt Concepts: No need to reinvent the wheel. Many concepts don't exist here yet. Import an idea and adapt it to local specificities. For example, a well-designed manicure booking service could be a hit.  9. Experience the Local Rhythm: Listen to music and explore local dances (hello twerk and bouyon!).   10. Smart Phone Plan: Take a metropolitan plan from Sosh. Plenty of Gigas to work from anywhere, and above all much cheaper than local telephone offers.  11. Join the Gwada Connexion group: If you are looking for the beating heart of the online community in Guadeloupe, look no further than the “Gwada Connexion” Facebook group ( link to group ).  It’s a real melting pot of exchanges, information and local tips. Imagine a place where you can find everything: sales announcements, travel advice, lively debates, and even rants or job offers.  12. Immerse yourself in the World of Local Podcasts: To truly understand the entrepreneurial spirit in Guadeloupe, there is nothing like listening to the stories and experiences of local actors through podcasts.   Here are some suggestions:  “Digital Sauces”: This podcast ( website ) focuses on digital and innovation. It offers in-depth interviews with local entrepreneurs, sharing their journeys, successes and advice. “We are reinventing the world”: This podcast offers a fascinating overview of the innovative ideas and projects that are shaping the future of Guadeloupe. He is an inspiration to anyone looking to make a positive change. “Outside the Zone”: Here, you will discover entrepreneurs who dare to think outside the box. It’s perfect for understanding the unique challenges and opportunities of island entrepreneurship. 13. Find out about the next “CrazyMonkey” events : Organized by Jordan Succar , a multi-hat Guadeloupean entrepreneur who has a thousand ideas at the minute.  Some examples of formats that he regularly organizes:  The Débouya Conf : These round tables bring together talented entrepreneurs for rich and qualitative discussions. They offer a unique platform to explore various topics from different angles, enriched by dynamic exchanges with the public. The Debouya Sprint: Halfway between a design thinking workshop and practical training, these sessions are the ideal place to quickly develop your skills. In a few days, you can immerse yourself in various fields such as no-code or automation, guided by inspiring and experienced speakers and trainers. Co-living: Imagine spending a week in a luxurious villa, surrounded by other entrepreneurs and freelancers, local and international. These stays are a perfect combination of invigorating activities like surfing and yoga, productive work sessions and invaluable networking opportunities. There you go, with these tips, you are ready to conquer Guadeloupe, while having fun. Good adventure !  My conclusion In summary, Guadeloupe is much more than just a vacation destination.

Safe in the city (Kigali), even at night. Amazing wildlife and scenery/landscapes if you get a place with a good view and some nature around. Government entities have their sh*t straight more than many other nations. Average internet. Stable power grid. Cons: dangerous near Virunga unless you go on a guided tour, water is unpotable and unsafe from the tap unless boiled even in Kigali, locals stare at you without interruption (not in a frightening way but it's uncomfortable), dangerous to navigate the traffic unless you're used to complete road chaos, slow/poor service in restaurants, everyone asks you for money even the children in rural villages where tourists don’t go, need a car/motorcycle to do anything (not a walkable city), very poor selection of anything in terms of shopping needs and expensive.

After it finds a driver, the driver will usually call you and ask where you are going (? the app doesn't show the location for them) and how much you'll pay (?). Most of the time, they won't move, so you have to cancel the ride and find another driver (thankfully, they don't charge for canceling rides).  Also, tuk-tuks have local gangs/cartels and won't let Pick Me drivers pick you up there, so you have to walk a bit far from where the tuk-tuks are parked; otherwise, the app drivers will be terrified of them - I've seen them argue and threat the Pick Me drivers.",colombo-sri-lanka,colombo,colombo-sri-lanka,2,400,207,41400,,79.95337995337995,"https://nomadlist.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,fit=cover,width=600,height=300,quality=25/https://nomadlist.com/assets/img/places/colombo-sri-lanka.jpg?1709770476",科伦坡,Colombo,斯里兰卡,59,,6.9270786,79.861243,Sri Lanka,LK,sri-lanka,,,,11,5,4.222857142857142,76,1300,wi-day-rain,🌧,29,83.616,34,93,1217,679,399,1395.2680364097675,1.3804490452301776,1.3804490452301776,5,1.3857142857142857,0,4

You have to carry cash around and lots of bills as worth 1/40th of what they were a few years ago. You can't really use cards anywhere, except dollar ATMs and some supermarkets.  Electricity mostly from generators, which have downtime a few hours a day. You need to check the daily hours of supply for the building before booking a place. 4G internet good 30+Mbps. Wired internet variable. Local SIM, I got a Touch Lebanon one with 20GB data for about $25/month. Pricier if you buy at the airport. Airport close to city centre. $10-15 taxi fare. Uber and Bolt work but you must assign payment as cash and it will be more than the app says, because of the high downward volatility of the LBP currency. Some classier cafes or restaurants will take USD notes but mostly you need LBP.  Heaps of culture and history. Heaps of street art.

The main street of the city is Krasnaya street and you can take a bike and go through the whole street and enjoy the beauty and the peace of the city. In terms of natural beauty, go to parks like Solnechniy ostrov, Dendrarium, Zaton, etc. Most likely you'll enjoy the most in the center of the city.

Uber is widely used there, although it's operating under the brand Yandex.Taxi nowadays, so you might rather use that service in Russia. Overall, a good city to live in and not expensive. If you want to eat cheap go to a small family-restaurants. Air is quite polluted, unfortunately. Driving also not recommended. Streets are narrow and driving is chaotic.

If you don’t know, it’s a big problem. Have an advice from the local, it’s important ⚠️ You should have a key for great experience in Kharkiv, get it! 🔑 WHY KHARKIV? Cool, well-educated people with own opinion, business-minded, direct. You’ll not find old historical buildings here the city was rebuilt ground up after WW2. The city is managed better than any other Ukrainian city, it’s clean. Not soviet in it’s heart ❤️  WHERE TO BE? Draw a triangle between Gor Kafe 1654 (tip), Otakara Yarosha st. (bottom). Rent there, live there, walk there, party there 😎 WHERE I LIKE TO WALK 1) Gorky Park, 2) Sarzhyn Yar (subway station Botanical Garden), 3) Pushkinskaya str. + around NTU “KHPI”, 4) Sumskaya + Rymarskaya. TAXI ONLY right now ON Taxi app with business class cars is the best and rather cheap, Uber and Bolt are so-so. HOTEL ONLY I’d not rent an apartment as prices aren’t fair (you can get a lot of money if you rent your apartment 10-15% a year 😉) rather look for a modern hotel like: 4 rooms and villa 4 rooms, Cosmopolit, Mirax, etc. normal Eastern European prices, rooms are spacious. DON’T WORRY it’s a safe place to be. I was never robbed or attacked even in scary 90-s, walking alone around dark, grotesque post-soviet haunted houses or empty streets, np at all. Locals love tourists and will help when they can, if you lost and people around don’t know English, you’ll soon find someone who’ll guide you, give you money and a good advice.

Modern apartment blocks are going up like crazy, but from a low base so housing can still be relatively expensive for what you get. It's enough to give you a home base to explore other areas of the country (which are insane travel experiences), and there is a young professional/expat scene to engage with when the rest of the city is overbearing.
